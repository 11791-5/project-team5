Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24022393 offsetBegin: 569 offsetEnd: 613 A: Tenderness in non-swollen joints may also be due to painful disorders like fibromyalgia , which occurs in 12 -- 20 % of patients with RA .21 All this may cause misinterpretations and missed remissions , conceivably more often by the more stringent criteria . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women?

Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24022393 offsetBegin: 856 offsetEnd: 883 A: The low frequency of sustained remission by the Boolean Cr suggests that they may be too stringent to be suitable for long-term studies in clinical practice . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24022393 offsetBegin: 883 offsetEnd: 925 A: In the present study , the exclusion of PatGA from the Boolean Cr and the SDAI Cr resulted in an increase in the rate of sustained remission from 3 % to 9 % and 5 % to 8 % , respectively . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24022393 offsetBegin: 925 offsetEnd: 935 A: This effect was not seen with the DAS28 Cr . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24022393 offsetBegin: 957 offsetEnd: 1001 A: This could partly be explained by the fact that the contribution of PatGA to DAS28 is only 15 % .25 A VAS PatGA of 2 -- 3 cm was not infrequent in patients in sustained remission by DAS28Cr -LRB- data not shown -RRB- . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24022393 offsetBegin: 1001 offsetEnd: 1024 A: The formula for DAS28 allocates twice as much weight to the number of tender joints as to the number of swollen joints . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24022393 offsetBegin: 1024 offsetEnd: 1123 A: This , for example , means that while remission can be missed with one swollen joint and three tender joints , it can be achieved with one tender joint and five or even more swollen joints .25 Consequently , the DAS28 Cr has been criticised for allowing classification of patients as being in remission in spite of having several swollen joints , not compatible with a state of remission .6 However , in the group of patients who achieved sustained remission in the present study , only a minority had more than a few tender or swollen joints . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24022393 offsetBegin: 1123 offsetEnd: 1143 A: So , it seems reasonable to use DAS28 Cr for the definition of sustained remission in this patient material . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24022393 offsetBegin: 1143 offsetEnd: 1287 A: Furthermore , tender joints in the absence of swelling have been shown to be unrelated to active synovitis diagnosed by ultrasound or power Doppler , which suggests that tender joints , which are not swollen , may be a source of misclassification .26 Gender may influence remission rates .16 In the BARFOT study , we have earlier reported that sustained remission from years 2 -- 5 , determined by the DAS28 -LRB- 2.6 criterion , was significantly less frequent in women than in men .27 Furthermore , women had higher DAS28 after 5 and 8 years than men , but no gender difference was observed in radiographic progression .28 29 Similarly , in the present study , sustained remission by all criteria was significantly less frequent in women than in men , while radiographic joint damage was similar -LRB- data not shown -RRB- . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24022393 offsetBegin: 1287 offsetEnd: 1306 A: The explanation to this inconsistency is probably that non-inflammatory pain confounds the measurement of disease activity in women . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24022393 offsetBegin: 1306 offsetEnd: 1333 A: Ideally , a state of sustained remission should indicate that disease activity is virtually absent and thus eliminate or minimize the risk of further joint damage .

Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24022393 offsetBegin: 1361 offsetEnd: 1431 A: In the Fin-RaCo study , sustained remission by the DAS28 Cr over 2 years was associated with only modest radiographic joint damage , and in the PREMIER study , sustained remission during the second year was associated with arrest of joint damage , irrespective of the therapy given .30 31 As a consequence , the authors proposed that sustained remission should be the ultimate goal of treatment of RA . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24022393 offsetBegin: 1500 offsetEnd: 1547 A: However , the degree of radiographic damage was minor in the groups of patients in sustained remission and often below ` the lowest value of minor radiological change ' .12 Similar results were obtained using different cut-off values for radiographic progression -LRB- data not shown -RRB- . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24022393 offsetBegin: 1547 offsetEnd: 1564 A: So , sustained remission by all criteria seems to be associated with slow long-term radiographic progression .

Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24022393 offsetBegin: 1639 offsetEnd: 1691 A: Another possible explanation is the presence of subclinical inflammation , which may cause progressive joint damage in patients without clinical evidence of inflammation .32 However , in the patients in sustained remission in this study , the radiographic joint damage over the 8 years was very limited and similar between criteria .

Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24022393 offsetBegin: 32 offsetEnd: 73 A: The data suggest that the Boolean Cr , although performing well in clinical trials , are very stringent and bring about risks for misclassifications mainly due to the requirement of a very low PatGA and hence risk for over treatment . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24022393 offsetBegin: 73 offsetEnd: 109 A: Similar objections may be made to the use of the SDAI Cr , which may make these criteria less appropriate for use in long-term studies in which PatGA frequently may be increased due to comorbidities . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24022393 offsetBegin: 109 offsetEnd: 125 A: Both these sets of criteria classified more patients in sustained remission when PatGA was excluded . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24022393 offsetBegin: 125 offsetEnd: 159 A: However , using criteria without PatGA means that the much wanted patient perspective of the criteria is abandoned .34 Furthermore , cut-offs for remissions have not been established for criteria without VAS PatGA . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24022393 offsetBegin: 159 offsetEnd: 178 A: The DAS28 Cr performed reasonably well in this 8-year study and presented very little of previously observed drawbacks . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24022393 offsetBegin: 178 offsetEnd: 214 A: In spite of more patients in sustained remission by DAS28 Cr , radiographic damage and disability were apparently not worse than what was seen with the other criteria and the patients ' perspective was preserved . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24022393 offsetBegin: 214 offsetEnd: 233 A: The DAS28 Cr may therefore still be used in long-term observational studies until more accurate criteria are available .

Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 108 offsetEnd: 146 A: In terms of efficacy -LRB- secondary objective -RRB- , esomeprazole proved efficacious in preventing the recurrence of peptic ulcers in this at-risk patient population , with an overall estimated ulcer-free rate after 1 year of 95.9 % . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 146 offsetEnd: 187 A: Such findings compare favourably with a similar study of lansoprazole in Japanese long-term NSAID users and a history of peptic ulcer , in which the estimated ulcer-free rate after 1 year was somewhat lower at 87.3 % -LRB- 18 -RRB- . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women?

Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 220 offsetEnd: 261 A: These results , together with the favourable safety and tolerability findings , are consistent with previous long-term studies of esomeprazole for prevention of pre-specified GI symptoms and peptic ulcers in European and North American patients receiving NSAIDs -LRB- 12,13 -RRB- . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 261 offsetEnd: 313 A: Indeed , the ulcer-free rate with esomeprazole 20 mg od in the present 1-year study -LRB- 95.9 % -RRB- is better than those seen in the placebo-controlled , 6-month VENUS and PLUTO studies -LRB- ulcer-free rates of 94.7 % and 94.8 % , respectively ; life-table estimates -RRB- -LRB- 13 -RRB- .

Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 341 offsetEnd: 390 A: In accordance with earlier studies -LRB- 13 -RRB- , we found that esomeprazole seemed to be similarly efficacious for prevention of peptic ulcers irrespective of the type of NSAID that the patient was being treated with -LRB- non-selective or COX-2 selective -RRB- , although patient numbers were small . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 390 offsetEnd: 424 A: Unfortunately , we were not able to evaluate the efficacy of esomeprazole according to the duration of NSAID treatment prior to study start , as such information was not collected during baseline assessments . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 424 offsetEnd: 446 A: This represents a potential study limitation , as duration of prior NSAID treatment could impact on the risk of ulcer recurrence . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 446 offsetEnd: 500 A: H. pylori status did not seem to substantially impact the therapeutic efficacy of esomeprazole -LRB- as also observed for lansoprazole in a similar Japanese population -LRB- 18 -RRB- -RRB- , and this is consistent with findings showing that eradication of this pathogen does not prevent recurrent ulcers in NSAID users -LRB- 19 -RRB- . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 500 offsetEnd: 533 A: Notably , our study population included a larger proportion of H. pylori-positive patients -LRB- 43.8 % -RRB- than comparable studies in Western populations -LRB- 10 -- 20 % -RRB- -LRB- 12,13 -RRB- . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 533 offsetEnd: 550 A: Esomeprazole is mainly metabolised by CYP2C19 -LRB- 20 -RRB- , which is subject to genetic polymorphism . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 550 offsetEnd: 581 A: Consequently , we performed genetic testing of CYP2C19 genotype in order to determine whether this influenced long-term efficacy of esomeprazole for prevention of peptic ulcers in our at-risk Japanese population . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 581 offsetEnd: 610 A: Overall , CYP2C19 genotype did not indicate any major impact on the gastroprotective efficacy of esomeprazole , as the estimated ulcer-free rates were similar for all CYP2C19 genotypes . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 610 offsetEnd: 647 A: While the results are limited by the small number of patients , they are in agreement with previous findings that esomeprazole-mediated healing of reflux -LRB- erosive -RRB- esophagitis is unrelated to CYP2C19 genotype -LRB- 21 -RRB- . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 647 offsetEnd: 682 A: We observed a low incidence of dyspeptic symptoms during the present study , which is consistent with findings elsewhere that esomeprazole provides sustained relief from such symptoms in long-term NSAID users -LRB- 12 -RRB- . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 682 offsetEnd: 714 A: However , it should be noted that few patients reported such symptoms at baseline ; for example , only 18 patients -LRB- 13.8 % -RRB- reported epigastric pain with NSAID therapy . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 714 offsetEnd: 748 A: This may be somewhat discordant from studies in Western populations that have reported upper GI symptoms , such as dyspepsia , in as many as 40 % of NSAID users -LRB- 22 -RRB- . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 748 offsetEnd: 795 A: Nevertheless , we believe our study population to be representative of Japanese NSAID users , given that the baseline rate of dyspeptic symptoms was generally comparable to the reported incidence in a recent meta-analysis of NSAID treatment studies of osteoarthritis patients in Japan -LRB- 23 -RRB- . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 795 offsetEnd: 811 A: This difference may be important when interpreting the dyspeptic symptom findings during long-term esomeprazole therapy . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 811 offsetEnd: 837 A: A strength of the present study was that it used endoscopic endpoints rather than surrogate markers of peptic ulcer recurrence , such as symptom relapse . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 837 offsetEnd: 859 A: Frequent endoscopic assessment also served to ensure that the at-risk study population was closely monitored for prompt detection of ulcer recurrence . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 859 offsetEnd: 893 A: Another strength is that concomitant use of mucosal protectants such as gefarnate , which are frequently used in Japan to reduce the risk of peptic ulcers with NSAID therapy , was not permitted . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 893 offsetEnd: 925 A: This helped to ensure that the true gastroprotective effect of esomeprazole was observed , without confounding by the moderate efficacy of mucosal protection noted in comparable long-term studies -LRB- 18 -RRB- . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 925 offsetEnd: 961 A: The lack of a placebo or active treatment comparator could be considered a study limitation , although use of a placebo arm would be unethical in a study population at high risk of ulcer recurrence . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 961 offsetEnd: 984 A: Moreover , the existence of an extensive published literature on esomeprazole in long-term NSAID users allows some historical comparisons to be made . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 984 offsetEnd: 1004 A: Indeed , findings in the present Japanese population are in agreement with results from other populations -LRB- 12,13 -RRB- . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 1004 offsetEnd: 1019 A: Another limitation is that compliance was measured by returned capsule counting and NSAID diaries . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 1019 offsetEnd: 1045 A: While this was the only feasible option in the current study , we have to accept the limitations of such an approach for evaluating compliance . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 1045 offsetEnd: 1070 A: The small size of the study also has to be considered , as this precludes the precise evaluation of rare AEs such as fracture . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 1070 offsetEnd: 1106 A: Indeed , there has been concern about the moderately elevated risk of fracture -LRB- hip , spine and wrist -RRB- with PPI long-term therapy based on a recent meta-analysis of observational studies -LRB- 24 -RRB- . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women?

Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 1160 offsetEnd: 1208 A: Concerns have also been raised about the increased risk of pneumonia with long-term PPI therapy in some -LRB- 25 -RRB- but not all -LRB- 26 -RRB- studies , although only 1 patient experienced such an event that was considered possibly-related to study drug in the present investigation . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 1208 offsetEnd: 1232 A: Larger studies of PPI therapy in at-risk NSAID users will be required to explore the risk of these rare AEs in greater detail . 
Q:Is Rheumatoid Arthritis more common in men or women? Document:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530709 offsetBegin: 0 offsetEnd: 37 A: Conclusions In according with previous findings , esomeprazole 20 mg od had a favourable safety profile and was efficacious at preventing ulcer recurrence during long-term treatment in Japanese NSAID users with a history of peptic ulcer .
