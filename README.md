DESIGN OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEM Project


We implement a Question-Answering pipeline in the likes of IBM Watson. The pipeline is composed of components to retreive concepts, documents, and RDF triples for a biomedical question answering pipeline.

The pipeline accepts a biomedical question, queries various biological ontologies and extracts relevant snippets that answer the given question.

Example:
Q: "What is the most prominent sequence consensus for the polyadenylation site?"
A: "AATAAA","AAUAAA"
